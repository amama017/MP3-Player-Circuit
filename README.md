# MP3-Player-Circuit
Our project is about building a standalone Kit that doesnâ€™t interface with any other device to perform its primary function, that is Reading a MP3 song from an SD Memory card and decode it to Analog signal to send it to the speakers, interfaced with the user using a keyboard matrix, using ATMEL AT90S8515 Microcontroller programmed with assembly using AVR tools 4.
